# Design
1. 
A very helpful thing to focus on for designing our bot was coding based on what we have our story task assigned to. A good way of gauging how difficult the task we had at hand was through Planning Poker, where we assigned a certain value of story points to each task. It was helpful to have a clear idea of the goal at hand while developing the code for it. 
2.
The most difficult part in designing our project was getting used to working with Discord bots. Early on in this project I personally ran into issues in making my own bot for testing before I made the switch to the overall bot we used for the project. I had problems with working with the DISCORDTOKEN required for accessing the bot which were soon resolved after some assistance from my groupmates. If I were to do this project again, I would try to avoid these connection problem I originally dealt with.

A design method that was a lot of fun that I would definitely use for future projects is the Planning Poker game. It is a very fun way of understanding what each group member is capable of and works great for assigning tasks accordingly. I would also continue using the Project Board of keeping record for what tasks are assigned to which group member.

# Implementation
1.
The most helpful aspect of testing our project was making sure that our code would work even after being merged with each other's work. There were scenarios where my part of the code could only function after properly merging with a groupmates code. For example, I was in charge of making sure the bot would return an error message in the case of someone entering an entry in the wrong format. My part required the help of what a groupmate wrote for their task, which was allowing a user input for the bot to respond to.
2.
The most difficult part of the implementation process of this project was the use of Javascript for a discord bot. I have had prior knowledge for working with a discord bot in other languages I am more proficient in such as Python, but when it came to working on it with Javascript it proved to be noticeably more challenging than I had remembered. If I were to do anything differently for this project, I would have done it in a language I am more fluent in using.
3.
Implementation methods that I plan on using in future projects in my career is the use of github for sharing code among my groupmates. Github is a very reliable way to keep group files in order alongside my teammates work as well as a great way to keep notice on different issues and tasks that everyone in the group is focusing on. In specific to this bot, I would like to try and experiment with making more implementations to the current bot that we already have, such as making our own examples for inputs that could not be found on StackOverflow.

# Process
1.
The most helpful part about code review is how it makes group work more efficient. It is very beneficial for making nice looking and easy to read code by adding comments and condensing unnecessary areas. It helps by both allowing the reviewer to make the code they are working with more understandable to anyone else that would have to interact with it, as well as the reviewee, who can learn from the edits made by the reviewer in order to understand better coding practices.
2.
There was not many difficulties in our process section of this project besides finding proper times to meet with one another. The group had very different schedules so our meeting times were very limited to weekends and class times. Other than that there was very little issues in making and monitoring our kanban board as well as reviewing each other's code.
3.
The most valuable practice that was used in this project I will be using in the future is the kanban board. It was a very crucial part of establishing order and keeping tasks in check during this project and the game we played in order to set up our board was a very interesting and fun way to get a kickstart to this project.

# Overall
Most of the practices used in the design, implementation, and process for this project were very useful for keeping the team working together and accomplishing our goals in a timely fashion. The kanban board kept us all focused on our individual tasks and the game of Planning Poker helped gauge each of our strengths and weaknesses for finding which task was most fitting for which team member. The only real difficulties that we faced through this project besides general understanding of the language being used was trying to meet regularly on times where everyone was not held up with other classes.
